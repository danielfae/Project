Final Project
=======

Online surveys depending on location of surveyor and the option for a Newsletter subscription.

Using Google Maps API I want to display places in the world where a person wants to give away a survey for anyone to fill out.

The surveys will be created and administered using SurveyMonkey API.

Finally, I will add a Newsletter subscription using Mailchimp API.

Physical Computing

For the Physical Computing aspect of the project, I want to implement a device using Beagle Board able to navigate and answer the questions.
