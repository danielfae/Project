Final Project
=======

Online surveys depending on location of surveyor and the option for a Newsletter subscription.

Using Google Maps API I want to display places in the world where a person wants to give away a survey for anyone to fill out.

The surveys will be created and administered using SurveyMonkey API.

Finally, I will add a Newsletter subscription using Mailchimp API.

This will be acomplished independently for a personal project without the use of the BeagleBone.


Physical Computing

For the Physical Computing aspect of the project, I want to implement a device using the BeagleBone that enable the user to interact with the surveys displayed on the browser thought buttons. This device will specifically help to navigate and answer the questions one by one in an interactive way.

1. The person who will use my project is a client of any company that wants to give feedback of the service/product throught a device that give results of acomplishment or satisfaction according to the answers given by the user.

2. This companies that need satisfaction rates from the clients or companies that want to evaluate a certain level of proficiency in a determined skill(e.g: Leadership). In an standalone implemented device, you can deploy the device around a city, to make surveys to people that want to make part of any study. 

3. The first ten minures of using/interacting with my project will look like: a screen where questions will pop out and the user would need to answer with the buttons associated to each of the available options to choose. the result would be a calification of the performace obtained during the questionarie or a reward for having accomplish it.

4. By the end of tonight, I'd like to be able to: Setup buttons to press on BeagleBone and have a response to save in variables on javascript.
